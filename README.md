# Turbo Fat
A block-dropping puzzle game. This is inspired by a few other block-dropping games but breaks some rules.

  * Most games reward you for tidy horizontal stacks, but Turbo Fat rewards you for messy vertical stacks.
  * Most games punish you for leaving horizontal crevices in your stack, but Turbo Fat encourages you to create these types of crevices and lets you squeeze pieces into them.
  * Most games reward making a tall narrow column where you can clear multiple lines at once, but Turbo Fat punishes this. There are no line pieces and you do not score bonus points for simultaneous line clears.
  * Most games reward you for building a mountain of blocks, and tearing it down with a big combo. Turbo Fat allows this, but you can fill up your screen while building a combo.
  * Most games limit your combo by the number of blocks on the screen. In Turbo Fat, combos can continue forever.

While this game is still in development, my goal is for it to include three different modes:

  * A sustained marathon mode which lasts about 10 minutes, and the player is graded based on their performance. They might aspire to get a 'grand master' grade by playing better.
  * Several shorter sprint modes which last about 3 minutes, and the player is given a score or a time. They might aspire to finish faster or score more points.
  * A story mode made up of a wide variety of 3 minute scenarios. Some scenarios reward the player for learning basic game concepts and playing better. Other scenarios force the player to adapt to unusual scenario-specific rules. Some mandatory scenarios block the player's progress until they're able to clear them.

## Controls

In the puzzle mode, use the **arrow keys** to control the piece, **Z/X** to rotate the piece, and **shift** to hard drop. **Esc** when you want to stop playing.

In the overworld, press the **arrow keys** to move, **Z** to talk, and **shift** to rewind dialog. **Esc** brings up a menu.

Gamepads are also supported.
