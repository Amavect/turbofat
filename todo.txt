The idea of different background colors was appealing, but Godot does not support background colors for 2D Viewports (#252) or any way to combine to images. While I suppose it's probably technically possible to perform pixel-by-pixel manipulation to give an image a background, it seems sort of insane and I don't want to do it.

-(later) Includes metadata, 'import photo' feature
-(later) Exported creatures don't have an outline

-fix: 
 -photo frame script
 -'outline' material
 -'node not found' warning
