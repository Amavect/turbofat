*better scaling of blocks, should look good at large resolutions
*code style
-additional game modes
 *new flow...
 *create marathon difficulties
 -marathon mode ends at a certain line count
 -buttons take you to different difficulties
  -marathon: normal (1-50 ??G)
  -marathon: hard: (1-100 0.25G)
  -marathon: expert (1-200 1G)
  -marathon: impossible (1-300 20G)
 -save high score
 -ultra: normal (200 points), hard (500 points), expert (1,000 points), impossible (3,000 points 20G)
  -finishing ultra has a less spectacular ending... 'time up' noise, less delay
 -sprint: normal (1:30), hard (2:00), expert (2:30), impossible (3:00)
  -finishing sprint has a less spectacular ending... 'time up' noise, less delay
