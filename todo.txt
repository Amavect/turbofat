*better scaling of blocks, should look good at large resolutions
*code style
*revisit kicks
*slow the game down a lot?
*when dying, pieces shouldn't look strange and chopped off
*additional game modes
 *new flow...
 *create marathon difficulties
 *marathon mode ends at a certain line count
 *buttons take you to different difficulties
 *sprint: normal (2:00), hard (2:30, 1G) which has faster piece lock times
 *ultra: normal (200 points), hard (500 points), expert (1,000 points), impossible (3,000 points 20G)
*finishing sprint/ultra should have a less spectacular ending... 'time up' noise, less delay
*when holding rotate, pieces should consistently spawn at the top of the well (or one higher)
*when dying, pieces shouldn't look strange and chopped off
*save high score
