*benchmark creature stress test for 100% viewport size
*benchmark creature stress test for 40% viewport size
-decrease creature viewport scale
 -try 100% scale (instead of 250%)
  -move very slow
  -outlines are too thick
 -experiment with rescaling parameters (fuzzy scaling? other kinds of scaling?)
 -meet somewhere in the middle
-decrease creature viewport size
 -try 50% size
 -move viewport around so the 50% size change is transparent
 -increase to 100% size as creature gets fatter
 -change lower bound; how small can we make it?
-experiment with making viewport render less frequently
 -1 fps; benchmark creature stress test
 -meet somewhere in the middle?
-benchmark creature stress test with new parameters
-more efficient outline shader?
 -using textureLod?
-cleanup
 -enable vsync
-merge



TEXTURE_SCALE = 0.4:
Creature/CreatureOutline/Viewport/Visuals position = 512,912


    -(move Creature/CreatureOutline/Viewport/Visuals position from 512,912 to 412, 712?)
    -(change Viewport, TextureRect size from 1200x1200 to 1000x1000)
